# VRC Game
 There is this app called VRC which stands for Virtual Radar Client. It is primarily used on the VATSIM network to see the virtual pilots. The developer allows users to add a server using a file called "myservers.txt". It is supposed to be used to allow people to add the training servers (aka Sweatbox) but can be used for other purposes, for example, allowing users to view ADSB traffic. I'm using that feature to create a game like ATCPro or Tower3DPro, that will (hopefully) feature voice recognition and TTS. This project has 7 stages. Right now, the first stage is adding file processing. The plan is to read the Euroscope Simulator File Format which has no documentation but is pretty self-explanatory. The second stage is getting a server working that VRC can connect to. The third stage is making VRC recognize that there are controllers online, and the 4th is adding planes. The fifth stage is making planes move, and the 6th is adding speech. The final stage is polishing and adding the ability for handoffs to work. I'm hosting all of the code in this organization for those who know what they are doing and want to contribute or if you want to keep track of development. I plan to update this blog every now and then with progress on the sim
