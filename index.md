# VRC Game
 There is this app called [VRC](https://vrc.rosscarlson.dev) which stands for Virtual Radar Client. It is primarily used on the 
 [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net) network to see the virtual pilots. 
 The developer allows users to add a server using a file called "myservers.txt". It is supposed to be used to allow people to add the training servers (aka Sweatbox) 
but can be used for other purposes, for example, allowing users to view 
[ADSB traffic](https://github.com/Sequal32/vrclivetraffic). I'm using that feature to create a game like [ATCPro](https://atcprosim.com) or [Tower3DPro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/588190/Tower3D_Pro/), 
that will (hopefully) feature voice recognition and TTS. This project has 9 stages. 

1. [Documentation of FSD protocol](https://github.com/VRCGame/FSD-Documentation)
2. Development of a TCP Server for VRC
3. Adding controllers and planes
4. Making planes move
5. Creating working Handoffs/Pointouts
6. Allowing scenario files
7. Speech Commands
8. Text to speach
9. Polishing

You can contribute during all of them by clicking on the stage. I will link all of the repos as I create them. This blog will be used to post updates/explain some confusing bits.
